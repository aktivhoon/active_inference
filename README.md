# Active Inference with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that aim to explain the concept of active inference based on the book ["Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind"](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5299/Active-InferenceThe-Free-Energy-Principle-in-Mind). The purpose of these notebooks is to facilitate self-study and understanding of active inference principles.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the examples provided in this repository may be simplified or inaccurate representations of real-world scenarios. They are intended solely for educational purposes and should not be considered as definitive or comprehensive implementations. We encourage users to consult the book and other authoritative resources for a complete understanding of active inference.

The repository includes several examples demonstrating the application of active inference concepts. These examples may cover various domains and use cases, exploring different aspects of active inference. It is important to note that these examples might exhibit some bias towards situations in psychiatry. This is because one of the contributors to this repository is a psychiatry resident and has focused on incorporating active inference principles into mental health research.
